  "Tips": {
    "Well Formed": "When creating your user stories, always make sure that there is a Role, an Action and a Benefit - and that these match with each other! Reread the context carefully when you are unsure of the possible matches.",
    "Atomic": "Make sure that your user stories only tackle one issue at a time. A tell to look for is the word 'and' within either an action or a benefit; I want to do this <and> this usually points towards multiple problems within one user story - therefore not atomic!",
    "Minimal": "Make sure that your user stories contain only a role, an action and a benefit. If a user story contains additional information such as examples and extra descriptions, a user story is not mimimal.",
    "Problem Oriented": "Always check if your user stories only specify problems, not solutions. If any of your user stories include specific solutions, program names, resources etc, it is most likely not problem oriented!",
    "Full Sentence": "Always read the user story while making it and check if it makes grammatical sense as a sentence. Does this sound like a natural English sentence? Are their any random words without context?",
    "Unambiguous": "When creating your user stories, make sure that the descriptors are specific enough. Do you have phrases or words like 'thingss' or 'the duties' that are too vague and could mean anything? Then the user story is not unambiguous!",
    "Independent": "Make sure that your user stories stand on their own. When you see a pointer towards another user story (e.g. 'please see user story 8' or 'check the pdf'), your user story is not independent as it depends on these other files!"
