Learning requirements notations is a tedious task for most people, because this learning activity is all but engaging. As an alternative to traditional educational methods, this is BakeRE, a serious educational game for requirements engineering. The game focuses on specific learning objectives: the specification and analysis of requirements with user stories. It is an engaging, multilevel puzzle game that can complement courses (traditional or on-line), such as a general software engineering or a specialized RE course. 

This game is created as a part of a Utrecht University Business Informatics master thesis project. BakeRE will be used as a part of the RE course in 2019.
